# Replication package for "Homophily in Voting Behaviour: Evidence from Preferential Voting" 

by Lucie Coufalová, Štěpán Mikula (stepan.mikula@econ.muni.cz), and Michal Ševčík

Homophily is a strong determinant of many types of our relationships, apart of whom we marry it may also affect whom we vote for. We use data on preferential voting from 2006, 2010, 2013, and 2017 Czech parliamentary elections matched with 2011 Census data to identify the effect of homophily on voting behavior. We find that one percent increase in the share of municipality population sharing the occupation and education level with the candidate increases the number of received preferential votes by 0.7\% and 0.5\% respectively. We also find that living in the municipality substantially increases the number of received preferential votes.
